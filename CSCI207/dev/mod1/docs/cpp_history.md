# History

## Origins in C (1979-1983)

Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began developing C++ at Bell Labs in 1979.
Stroustrup's initial motivation was to create a language that provided higher-level abstractions for programming tasks while retaining the efficiency and low-level control offered by the C programming language.

The first version of C++ was named "C with Classes," as it introduced the concept of classes to C, enabling object-oriented programming (OOP) features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
In 1983, the language was renamed C++ ("C plus plus"), reflecting its evolution from C.

## Early Releases and Evolution (1985-1990)

The first official release of C++ came in 1985. This version included features like classes, inheritance, virtual functions, and function overloading.
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, C++ gained traction among programmers, particularly in industries such as telecommunications, finance, and gaming, where its combination of performance and abstraction proved advantageous.

## Standardization Efforts (1990s)

In the early 1990s, efforts began to standardize the C++ language to ensure consistency and portability across different implementations.
The first standardized version of C++, often referred to as "C++98" or "ISO/IEC 14882:1998," was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998.
Standardization played a crucial role in establishing C++ as a widely-used programming language for both commercial and academic purposes.

## C++11 and Modern Features (2010s)

C++11, released in 2011, marked a significant milestone in the language's evolution. It introduced numerous modern features, including auto type deduction, lambda expressions, range-based for loops, and smart pointers.
Subsequent updates, such as C++14 and C++17, built upon the foundation laid by C++11, focusing on refining existing features and introducing new ones.
These updates aimed to make the language more expressive, safer, and efficient, catering to the evolving needs of software developers across various domains.

## Recent Developments (2020s)

C++20, released in 2020, brought several new features and enhancements, including modules, concepts, coroutines, and ranges.
The C++ standards committee continues to work on further improvements and additions to the language, with C++23 and beyond expected to introduce additional features and refinements.

Throughout its history, C++ has maintained its position as one of the most widely-used and influential programming languages, owing to its versatility, performance, and extensive standard library. Its evolution continues to be guided by the needs of developers and advancements in computer science and software engineering.
