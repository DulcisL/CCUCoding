# Module 3 Project

## Description

For this project create a menu that is displayed to the user that looks like this:

    1. Guess a number game
    2. Show lottery numbers
    3. Exit

The menu should be created by a function that returns a string that contains the menu output.

Create two functions, one for each of the first two picks, that do the following:

Guess a number game:
prompt the user to guess a number between 0 and 100
On each guess tell the user if the guess was low or high or that they guessed the number
Show the user how many guesses it took to guess the number

Show lottery numbers

Create 5 numbers that can not be duplicates between 1 and 50
Show those numbers to the user

Name all functions appropriately.
