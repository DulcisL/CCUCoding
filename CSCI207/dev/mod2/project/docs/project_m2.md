# Module 2 Project

## Description

Create a file called m2proj_flname.cpp only replace flname with your first initial and last name.
In it, create a function that creates a header similar to what is in m2debug.cpp. Name to function
something appropriate such as CreateAppHeader() for example. It should not display the header from
within the function, rather return a string to the main() funtion so it can be displayed there.

Look at the file main2.cpp that I provided to help in making your header pop with color and shapes.
Be creative.
