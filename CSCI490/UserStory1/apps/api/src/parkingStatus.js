/* parkingStatus file used for creating and updating the web page showing parking lot status.
  Desc: This will take the map and given data from SQL and change the parking lot color based on the 
  current fill of the parking lot at the given time.
  
  User Story: As a student I want to be able to see a visual reference of the current capacity 
  of the parking lot to easily judge the parking across campus. An example would be a map with 
  green, yellow, or red overlayed over the parking lots on campus.
