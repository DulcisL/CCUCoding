>## Setting up the environement
>
>1) First thing is to know which OS system that you will be using. For this I will be using Ubuntu Linux. 
>2) Next is to set up your IDE, any text editor will work, however I prefer Visual Studio Code (VS Code as I will refer to it)
>3) Once you have your IDE set up next will be to install node.js, this is where you can run and test your code. This is done in multiple ways, however I prefer to use the command line to do so
>    * First you will want to ensure your system is running the latest software so you will want to run the command:
>  `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
>    * Next you will want to ensure install from the repository
>   `sudo apt install nodejs npm`
>4) Finally you need to set up docker. Similarly I prefer to use the command line.
>    *  First you will need to get the repository over HTTPS:
>   `sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg lsb-release`
>    *  Then, add the docker official GPG key:
>   `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker.gpg`
>    *  Next, you will need to add the docker repository:
>   `echo \ "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null`
>    *  Finally, you will need install it:
>   `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin`

>### Notes
> * If running the environment in a container extra steps may be required and will be tailored to your own system and container.
