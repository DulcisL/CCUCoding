/* Main file for project
    This file is to focus on the user story of a map that shows the status of the parking lots across campus
        - "As a student I want to be able to see a visual reference of the current capacity of the parking 
        lot to easily judge the parking across campus. An example would be a map with green, yellow, or red
        overlayed over the parking lots on campus."
